# feedr

Feedr is an open source news platform based on RSS feeds without recommendation algorithms or
targeted advertising. Instead Feedr is designed to help you out of the media bubble presented
by modern news aggregators like Google News by giving you the tools to proactively find news on
the topics you are interested in and exchange articles and views with other users.
